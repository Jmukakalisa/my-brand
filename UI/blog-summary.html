                    <p>Nanotechnology is the term given to those areas of science and engineering where phenomena that take place at dimensions in <br> the nanometre scale are utilized in the design, characterisation, production and application of materials, structures, devices and systems
                    There are different opinions around nanotechnology where scientists and engineers believe nanotechnology can be used to benefit human health now and in the future through applications such as better filters for improving water purification, more effective methods of delivering drugs in medicine and new ways of repairing damaged tissues and organs. <br>                   
                    However, Improved control over materials does not just mean better products. As with any new technology, there are concerns about unknown effects and perhaps some extra ones, simply because nanotechnologies are so incredibly small.
                    This is not just because they seem insidious due to their invisibility. The properties of materials are influenced by different effects at very small scales, where quantum mechanical laws trump classical physics. And biological systems, in particular, may respond to nanomaterials in ways we do not like.
                    Many areas in which nanotechnology can be applied and be beneficial has been identified, such as:
                    Future Transportation Benefits
                    Environmental Remediation
                    Energy Applications
                    Medical and Healthcare Applications 
                    Electronics and IT Applications
                    Everyday Materials and Processes
                    Nanotechnology will help improve in different areas as mentioned above, Although it has some pros and cons. Some of the pros are: <br> It offers the potential for new and faster kinds of computers, more efficient power sources and life-saving medical treatments, there are Invisible particles that fight cancer cells, <br> faster microprocessors that consume less energy, batteries that last 10 times longer or solar panels that yield twice as much energy. But the disadvantage of it is that those Nanoparticles can get into the body through the skin, lungs and digestive system. This may help create 'free radicals' which can cause cell damage and damage to the DNA.
                    To sum up, In the future, nanotechnology might help us make electrical lines, solar cells, and biofuels more efficient, <br> and make nuclear reactors safer. Nanotechnology might lead to huge advances in health care, improving methods for detecting and treating diseases like cancer.   
                    While there are many nanotech uses, three areas of nanotech are paving the way to our future: Materials Science, Nanomedicine and Device Engineering.</p>
